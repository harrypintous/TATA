# QTS_Research: easy tool for quant trading strategy research  
Less code, more research.  
requirements: python 3 + numpy + pandas + quandl(or you can modify code to other datasource) + matplotlib(optional only if you need chart)  
copy the whole directory into your desired folder, modify Sample_Test.py and run it. remove the plot func if you not have matplotlib.  
haven't got time to write documentation, but debug always works :)
